1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your local?
When you're working from a machine different computer than usual or if you are collaborating with someone remotely.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository? 
 Git may commit/save changes that are not production ready or ready for the public in general.
